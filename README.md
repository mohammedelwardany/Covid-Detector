<h2>project description</h2>
<p>Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, 
and some cause disease. A coronavirus identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, 
has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19. We can 
detect COVID-19 from Chest X-RAY as in “figure 1.1” .Because of lack of 
doctors and the danger on them in examine the patients we will apply 
AI(artificial intelligence) that examine patients automatically with high 
accuracy to detect COVID-19 from Chest X-RAY . we have dataset from 
A team of researchers consists of 930 COVID-19 positive cases along 
with 930 Normal. At the first stage, this system runs our proposed 
image processing algorithm that analyzes the view of the lung to 
discard those Chest X-ray that inside the lung is not properly visible in 
them. This action helps to reduce the processing time and false 
detections. At the next stage, we apply keras application of ResNet50V2
model. Then we classify the dataset, After running these phase, the
system determines the condition of the patient using a selected 
threshold. We are the first to evaluate our system on ResNet50V2. In 
the single image classification stage, our 
model achieved 95.3% accuracy on more 
than 460 test images. At the patient 
condition identification phase, the system 
correctly identified almost 930 patients 
with high speed.</p>
